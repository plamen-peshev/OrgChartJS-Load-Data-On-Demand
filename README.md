# OrgChartJS Load Data On Demand
You can write code so that the chart only fetches the nodes that belongs to the current expanded node.

We recomend to use **Load on Demand** only if you have large number of data, if you have less that 50k nodes [lazyLoading](https://balkan.app/OrgChartJS/API/interfaces/OrgChart.options#lazyLoading) will do the job without adding extra complexity in your server side code with **Load On Demand**.
